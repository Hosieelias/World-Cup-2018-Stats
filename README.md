### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- Take user input from clickdown bar and get the matchday games
- call and use information from the api
- Show the user the games of the match day they chose and the scores
- shows teams that played
- responsive CSS

#### PostMVP  

- Allow for more in-depth stats on teams performances
- Use local storage to save users favorite teams
- Allow for another page with player stats
- add images of all teams 
- add best goal clip for each team

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.  

```
let h2 = document.createElement('h2');
    h2.innerText = selectedRound.matches[0].team1.name;
    divMatch.appendChild(h2)

        let p = document.createElement('p')
    p.innerText = selectedRound.matches[0].score1 + "-" + selectedRound.matches[0].score2
    divMatch.appendChild(p);

    // let p1 = document.createElement('p')
    // 
    // divMatch.appendChild(p1);
     
    let h3 = document.createElement('h3');
    h3.innerText = selectedRound.matches[0].team2.name;
    divMatch.appendChild(h3)
```
